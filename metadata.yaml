  Humans have a high level of attachment with their smartphones in this technological era.
  The smartphones not only make our life easier and organised, but also keep us entertained.
  Any threats to the smartphone will put its users' data at a risk.
  Out of smartphone Operating Systems (OSes), Android is highly popular.
  Its popularity has attracted considerable mass of malware into its ecosystem, 
  threatening the privacy and security of its users.
  Although many works are developed to detect Android malware,
  they either do not consider the complete structure contained in the Android Package (APK), or
  use features that are susceptible to obfuscation attacks.
  
  In this work, we propose an Android malware detection scheme using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
  applied on Function Call Graphs (FCGs) extracted from APK files.
  If the node-count distributions are drastically different for the classes,
  GCNs can be potentially biased towards a class. 
  To solve this, we propose a node-count balancing algorithm,
  which is applied on a latest Android malware dataset beforehand.
  After extracting FCGs from the APKs of the balanced dataset, 
  every node of FCG is assigned features that are resillient to obfuscation and representative of their content.
  We conducted a set of experiments to understand the effectiveness of features, contribution of GCNs and 
  suitable GCN algorithm. As a result of these experiments, we found that `SAGEConv` algorithm with 3
  GCN layers was effective in detecting Android Malware with 92.29% accuracy 
  using features derived from the method content. 
  As FCGs are derived entirely using the information present in the APK,
  we observe that callback information is not present in them, adding which, could improve the accuracy of the Android malware detection.
  
  To add callback information to the FCGs, the Android Framework has to be analysed. 
  We propose Android Framework analysis technique, using which callback information can be added to FCG.
  After adding these relationships, FCG become heterogeneous.
  To further enhance the information contained in FCG, we add permission information to it.
  The FCG with callback and permission information is termed as enhanced FCGs (eFCGs).
  As the FCGs are large in size, it can hinder the generalization ability of the malware detector.
  Therefore, we contract the nodes of the eFCG to obtain Reduced-eFCGs (R-eFCGs).
  We conducted a set of experiments to identify the essential components of eFCGs and R-eFCGs,
  optimal neighbourhood for GCNs and generalisation ability of R-eFCGs over eFCGs.
  As a result of these experiments, we obtained a maximum accuracy of 96.28% with R-eFCGs containing
  all their components at 4 GCN layers. We also observed that 2 GCN layers are sufficient for
  R-eFCGs to obtain a similar accuracy of 95.55%, thus determining it as a sweet spot between
  running time and the accuracy.
  
  We conclude that there is further scope to enhance this work by exploring more node features,
  different algortihms and explanability methods.
